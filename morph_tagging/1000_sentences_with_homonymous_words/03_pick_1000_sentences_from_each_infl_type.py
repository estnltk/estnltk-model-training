#
#   Picks randomly 1000 sentences for each target inflection types (1, 16, 17, 19) 
#   from the set of all extracted sentences containing words with homonymous forms 
#   ( `all_enc_koond_homonymous_forms_sentences.jl` ). 
#
#   Saves resulting sentences into directory 'random_pick_jl', into files which 
#   names follow the pattern: 
#       f'infl_type_{infl_type}_randomly_picked_1000_sentences_pick_{run_id}.jl'
#
#   By default, attempts to pick unique sentences across all inflection types. 
#
#   By default, attempts to discard all sentences picked in previous runs of 
#   this script. For this, collects all files from the outputdir that follow 
#   the pattern 
#       f'infl_type_{infl_type}_randomly_picked_1000_sentences_pick_{run_id}.jl'
#   and discards all sentences within these files.
#
#   Prints statistics about the whole dataset and about randomly picked subsets.
