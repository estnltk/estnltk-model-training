# Tests

Work in progress. 

Goal is to test the work of structuring analysis texts from text format to pandas dataframe (code in [analysis_text_parser](https://git.stacc.ee/project4/cda-data-cleaning/tree/master/cda_data_cleaning/data_cleaning/analysis_data_cleaning/step03_create_and_clean_analysis_texts/analysis_text_parser "analysis_text_parser")).

Right now has test files under [data](https://git.stacc.ee/project4/cda-data-cleaning/tree/master/cda_data_cleaning/data_cleaning/analysis_data_cleaning/step00_create_cleaning_functions). Input files are in .txt format and output is .csv (so it could be easily converted to pandas). Data is missing for type7.

Missing is code that formulates them into unittests.
