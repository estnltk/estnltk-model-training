The `data_extraction.ipynb` file takes the Wordnet source data as an XML file and creates DB files used by the Wordnet module. The paths for the XML file and the DB folder are set in the beginning of the IPYNB file and should be changed to correct paths before running the notebook. The IPYNB file is divided into three parts. First the necessary functions that extract the data from the XML file are defined. Next the functions are tested. Finally the functions are used to create the DB files which are then saved to the specified folder.
