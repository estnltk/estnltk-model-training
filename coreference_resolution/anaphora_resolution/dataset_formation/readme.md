# Dataset formation

We use ChatGPT to on random sentences to find sentences that contain antecendant in the sentence.
After that we use ChatGPT again to find which of the possible antecentants is the correct one.

This is an experimental workflow that must be refined further before we can use for creating the actual dataset.
